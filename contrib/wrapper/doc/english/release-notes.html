<p>
                    Modify the way boolean system properties are resolved by the WrapperManager
                    so it is now possible to set them to true or false rather than assuming they
                    are true if set.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Fix a problem where some localized error messages were not having their
                    tokens replaced correctly.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Fix a problem when using the WrapperStartStopApp helper class.  The usage
                    text was incorrectly being displayed in the console if an exception was
                    thrown while executing the main method of the configured stop class.  This
                    did not change the functionality of the application, but it did cause some
                    confusion.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Fix a problem on Windows where a library path or class path which ended in
                    a backslash was preventing the Wrapper from launching the JVM.  The Windows
                    OS was using the backslash to escape the quote used to close the path.  The
                    fix was to add a second backslash where needed.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Added a new <a href="prop-java-command-loglevel.html">wrapper.java.command.loglevel</a>
                    property which makes it possible to control the log level of the generated
                    java command.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Add support for escaped quotes when stripping quotes on UNIX for the
                    <a href="prop-java-additional-n.html">wrapper.java.additional.&lt;n&gt;</a> and
                    <a href="prop-app-parameter-n.html">wrapper.app.parameter.&lt;n&gt;</a>
                    properties.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Change the default value of <a href="prop-jvm-exit-timeout.html">wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout</a>
                    from 5 to 15 seconds.  The old default was too fast for some applications
                    which take a while to exit.  Applications which were exiting promptly will
                    not see any difference.
                </p>

<li>
                
<p>
                    Fix a problem where the JVM would restart at certain times when using the
                    system time based timer due to an overflow error.  This problem was
                    introduced in 3.1.0.  Due to a separate bug in 3.1.0, the Wrapper would
                    shutdown rather than simply restarting the JVM as was happening in 3.1.1.
                    The last restart happened on Aug 21, 2004.  It will next occur Oct 10, 2004
                    and repeat at regular intervals.  There are no problems when using the new
                    Tick based timer.

                    Correct the <a href="prop-logfile-maxsize.html">wrapper.logfile.maxsize</a>

                    is a megabyte.  We aren't a hard drive manufacturer after all.

<li>
                
<p>
                    Add try-catch blocks around all thread entry points in the Windows version.
                    This has always been done in the main function, but these blocks will help
                    to narrow down the cause of problems should they ever be encountered in
                    control or service handlers.
                </p>

<p>
                    Centralize shutdown code on UNIX version in an appExit method as was already
                    being done for Windows versions.
                </p>

<li>

                    Fix a problem where the build.sh was not correctly using the included ant
                    if an ANT_HOME environment variable was defined.
                </p>

<li>

                    Add a new <a href="prop-single-invocation.html">wrapper.single_invocation</a>
                    property which will prevent multiple invocations of an application from being
                    started on Windows platforms.  The shell script handles this on UNIX platforms.

<p>
                    Fix a crash problem introduced in 3.1.1, caused by a pair of uninitialized
                    pointers.  The crash was possible on all platforms but would only happen
                    if the Wrapper was started without any arguments.  It would not affect
                    users running the Wrapper normally.

                    Replace calls to usleep with nanosleep on platforms where it is available.
                    This was to fix an occasional hang on a specific Solaris machine.  It would
                    occasionally hang on calls to usleep.  From research, it appears that usleep
                    has problems when signals are encountered while sleeping.  Still testing
                    whether or not this change solved the problem.

                    another thread called System.exit while the Wrapper was shutting down.

                    Fix a problem introduced in 3.1.0 where a very very large CPU timeout
                    warning message was being displayed if the system time was set back
                    while using the default system timer.

                    Rewrote the routine which reads and logs console output from the JVM
                    for Windows versions.  Internal buffers are now scaled dynamically,
                    fixing a problem where long lines were being wrapped at 1024 characters.
                    This rewrite also resulted in a 4 fold increase in speed when the JVM is
                    sending large quantities of output to the console.

                    sent a SIGTERM prior to a SIGKILL.  The SIGTERM made no difference and
                    slowed down the forced shutdown.  A modification to the event loop made
                    the functionality more difficult to implement.

                    all users were experiencing it, but those who did were able to reliably
                    reproduce the problem.  The problem appears to have been caused by

                    The Windows version of the Wrapper was not correctly registering that it
                    would accept SHUTDOWN messages when running as a service.  The Wrapper
                    was getting the message anyway so this should not change functionality.
                    Thanks to Jason Tishler for noticing this and sending in a patch.

                    Add a new property, <a href="prop-native-library.html">wrapper.native_library</a>,

                    Modify the WrapperManager class so it now stores references to System.out
                    and System.err on initialization and always writes to those stored streams.
                    This makes sure that all Wrapper console output always goes to the
                    wrapper.log file even if user code overrides those streams with calls to
                    System.setOut and System.setErr.  This was necessary to prevent deadlocks
                    in such user code from affecting the functionality of the Wrapper.

                    to Eric Smith for tracking this down and submitting a patch.  It turns out

                    The WrapperManager class now checks to make sure that its current version
                    matches the version of the native library and Wrapper.  If there are any
                    discrepancies found then appropriate warnings will be displayed, but the
                    Application will still be allowed to start.  This was added to make obvious
                    the cause of problems resulting from mismatched versions.

<li>
                
<p>
                    Added a new property <a href="prop-use-system-time.html">wrapper.use_system_time</a> system time.  By setting this
                    property to false, the Wrapper will start using a new experimental timer
                    which uses a background thread to manage time rather than the system time.
                    This has a number of advantages over using the system time and should give
                    most users even more reliable behavior when the system is under high load
                    or there are changes being made to the system time.  The timer is very
                    critical to the operation of the Wrapper so the old behavior is left as
                    the default for the time being until this feature has had the chance to be
                    "time" tested.  If all goes well then this will be enabled as the default
                    in a future version of the Wrapper.
                    A pair of related properties, <a href="prop-use-system-time.html#prop-timer-fast-threshold">wrapper.timer_fast_threshold</a> and
                    <a href="prop-use-system-time.html#prop-timer-slow-threshold">wrapper.timer_slow_threshold</a>
                    were also added to aid in debugging.

                    Rework the logging code so it is now thread safe.  The addition of the
                    timer thread means that there is now more than a single thread accessing
                    that code.  This was causing problems as the two threads tried to use the
                    same buffers.  As part of this change, a new format variable 'D' was added
                    to display the thread which is doing the logging.

                    Add getUser and getInteractiveUser methods to the <a href="javadocs.html">WrapperManager</a>
                    class to make it possible for user code to query information about the user
                    running Wrapper or the user who is interacting with the Wrapper and its JVM.

<p>
                    The Wrapper will now always exit with the exit code used to terminate the JVM
                    whether System.exit is used or <a href="javadocs.html">WrapperManager.stop</a>.
                    When running as an NT service the Wrapper now correctly returns the correct
                    exit code to the service manager so failure recovery tools should now work
                    correctly.

                    Modify the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp so that the main method

                    To make debugging classpath problems easier, the Wrapper now verifies all
                    classpath entries before launching a JVM and logs debug level warnings for
                    any entries that do not exist.

                    Fix a problem where the first ping timeout after the JVM was started was
                    still hard coded at 30 seconds.  This was causing a combination of large
                    values of <a href="prop-ping-interval.html">wrapper.ping.interval</a>
                    and <a href="prop-ping-timeout.html">wrapper.ping.timeout</a> to fail.

                    Fix a problem where the JVM would fail to shutdown cleanly if the Wrapper
                    was asked to stop too soon after launching a JVM.  This was leading to the
                    JVM being killed after the shutdown timeout expired.

                    The bash script and the realpath utility have been deprecated since version
                    3.0.3.  They have been removed in this release.  The sh script is recommended
                    on all UNIX platforms, and the realpath utility which was used by pre-3.0.3
                    bash and sh scripts has not been used since.

                    Modify the way calls to System.in.read() are handled so that they now block
                    rather than throwing an exception.  Currently, System.in can not be used with
                    the Wrapper because of the way I/O is passed between the Wrapper and JVM.

                    Modified the Windows batch files to fix a problem where the path to the
                    Wrapper.exe contained more than one "/bin".  The new batch files are much
                    simpler and should be easier to customize if needed.  Bug #925308.

                    so that they now default to a value of 0 which causes the

                    parameters to be omitted from the command used to launch Java.  This
                    will cause the JVM to use its own default values and also makes it possible
                    to specify the memory parameters using the

                    Due to a bug in the build, the native library was not included in the 3.0.3
                    or 3.0.4 binary releases for OSX, building from source was working correctly.
                    This has been fixed and the build greatly simplified to avoid such problems
                    in the future.

                    This can be changed by setting the PIDDIR variable in the sh script used to
                    launch the Wrapper.

                        your configuration file.  You will get an error on startup if the specified

                    Modify the sh script so it works on Linux, then deprecate the bash script.
                    This means that all Unix platforms can now use the same script to control
                    the Wrapper. Thanks to Mike Castle for the patch.  The bash script can still
                    be found in the release, but it is deprecated and will be removed in a
                    future version.

                    Remove output to System.out in the WrapperManager.requestThreadDump() method.
                    If some JVM threads were hung while accessing the System.out object,
                    attempting to do a thread a dump would cause the calling thread to hang as

                    Added a pair of MBean interfaces which allow the Wrapper to be controlled
                    using JMX.  See the new <a href="jmx.html">JMX</a> section in the
                    documentation for details.  Thanks to Sal Ingrilli for help with testing.

                    Modify the Windows build so the Wrapper.exe and Wrapper.dll files can now
                    be built from <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a> if MSVC is
                    installed.

                    Added a new <a href="prop-ping-interval.html">wrapper.ping.interval</a>
                    property which lets users control the frequency that the Wrapper pings the JVM.
                    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=607768&group_id=39428&atid=425190">Feature Request #607768</a>.

<p>
                    When a JVM refuses to shutdown, the Wrapper can be configured to request a
                    thread dump using the <a href="prop-request-thread-dump-on-failed-jvm-exit.html">wrapper.request_thread_dump_on_failed_jvm_exit</a>
                    property.  The Wrapper was then waiting 1 second before the process was
                    killed.  This was not always long enough, resulting in a truncated thread
                    dump.  Increased the pause to 3 seconds.

                    Fix a problem on UNIX systems where requesting a second thread dump any time
                    during the life of a single Wrapper process would cause the Wrapper and JVM
                    to shutdown rather than perform the thread dump.

                    Fix a problem where a, user without permission, attempting to stop an
                    application was able to delete the pid file even though they were unable
                    to stop the application itself.  This would make the scripts think that
                    the application was stopped when was actually still running.

                    Fix a problem where an application was being killed prematurely if it took
                    longer than 6 seconds to exit on its own.  The scripts now make sure that
                    an application always has enough time to shutdown cleanly.

                    Improve the debug output so that packet codes are now shown using a name

                    Reduce the frequency of "Waiting to stop..." messages displayed when removing
                    an NT service that is currently running.  Decreased frequency from once per
                    second to once every five seconds.

                    Fix a minor problem where the hour in the date returned by
                    WrapperInfo.getBuildTime() was not base 24.

<li>
                
<p>
                    Added -t and -p command line options to the Windows version of the Wrapper
                    to sTart and stoP the Wrapper as an NT service.  This can be used in place
                    of "net start" and "net stop", which do not always work correctly when a
                    service takes a long time to start up or shutdown.  See the 
                    <a href="launch-win.html#exe">Launching Your Application (Win32)</a>

<li>
                
<p>
                    Add a new method WrapperManager.stopImmediate which will cause the JVM to
                    exit immediately without calling any stop methods or shutdown hooks.

<li>
                
<p>
                    Add a new class, WrapperActionServer, which makes it easy to remotely control
                    the Wrapper remotely by opening a socket and sending commands.  See the
                    <a href="javadocs.html">javadocs</a> of the class for more

                    Fix bug #744801.  A Java GUI was not being displayed when the application was
                    run in either console mode or as a service with <a href="prop-ntservice-interactive.html">wrapper.ntservice.interactive</a>
                    enabled.  This problem was introduced in Version 3.0.0 when using 1.2.x or
                    1.3.x versions of Java.  To use interactive services with 1.2.x or 1.3.x
                    versions of java, please review the documentation for the
                    <a href="prop-ntservice-interactive.html">wrapper.ntservice.interactive</a> property.

<p>
                    Fix a problem where the JVM was not receiving CTRL-C and CTRL-CLOSE events
                    when running under the Wrapper on Windows.  This was not a problem in most
                    cases as the Wrapper was taking care of the processing of the events.  But
                    the WrapperListener.controlEvent() method was not being called as documented.
                </p>
            
</li>
            
<li>
                
<p>
                    Changed the way the WrapperSimpleApp and WrapperStartStopApp respond to
                    control events so that the JVM will respond and call WrapperManager.stop()
                    even when being controlled by the Wrapper.
                </p>

<li>
                
<p>
                    Modified the suggested behavior of the WrapperListener.controlEvent() method.
                    Users who have implemented the WrapperListener interface themselves should
                    review the <a href="javadocs.html">javadocs</a>.  The changes are not
                    required and applications will continue to function as they did before.

                    Fix a problem where the sh and bash scripts were failing if the path to the

<p>
                    Fix a problem where the JVM would sometimes hang when trying to shutdown if
                    the wrapper.key parameter was passed to the JVM while not being controlled
                    by the Wrapper.  This would happen if a user copied the command from the
                    Wrapper's debug output and attempted to run it as is without first removing
                    the wrapper.key parameter.

                    Implement the ability to specify an NT service's load order group in response
                    to feature request #764143.  See the javadocs for the new
                    <a href="prop-ntservice-load-order-group.html">wrapper.ntservice.load_order_group</a>
                    property for details.

                    Improve the error message displayed when the NT EventLog is full in response
                    to feature request #643617.  The EventLog output will now be disabled if any
                    errors are encountered while logging events.  This prevents the error from
                    repeating.

                    Fix a problem where the Wrapper was leaving a pipe unclosed each time the JVM
                    was restarted on all UNIX platforms.  This was causing the Wrapper to run out
                    of file handles.   Bug #767267, discovered and patched by David Wong.

                    Fix a problem where the '#' character, which signifies a comment, could not
                    be included in property values.  A double hash, '##' will now resolve into a
                    '#' within the property value.  Bug #777303.

                    Changed the way environment variables are loaded from the registry on Windows
                    platforms so users will no longer get warning messages about not being able
                    to handle very large environment variables.  Prior versions could only handle
                    environment variables whose expanded value was less than 2048 characters in
                    length.

                    Fix a problem on UNIX platforms where a shell used to start the Wrapper
                    running as a detached process would hang when the user attempted to exit
                    the shell.  Thanks to Mike Castle for this patch.

                    default when the scripts are launched with the 'start' action.  Running with
                    the 'console' action will still send output to the console.  Logging to the

                    Modified the wrapper.ping.timeout property so it also controls the ping
                    timeout within the JVM.  Before the timeout on responses to the Wrapper
                    could be controlled, but the ping timeout within the JVM was hardcoded to
                    30 seconds.

                    In the last release, some work was done to avoid false timeouts caused by
                    large quantities of output.  On some heavily loaded systems, timeouts were
                    still being encountered.  Rather than reading up to 50 lines of input, the
                    code will now read for a maximum of 250ms before returning to give the main
                    event loop more cycles.

                    Fix a problem where the values of environment variables set in the

                    Fix a potential problem where the inability to expand very large environment

                    Add some extra checks in the event where the native library can not be loaded
                    so that the WrapperManager can differentiate between the library missing and
                    not being readable due to permission problems.

                    Remove the wrapper.ntservice.process_priority from the default wrapper.conf

                    Fix a problem where environment variables in the registry which had no value
                    were causing the Wrapper to crash with an access violation.  This was
                    introduced in version 3.0.0 with the feature to load environment variables
                    from the registry.  The offending registry entry was WV_GATEWAY_CFG which
                    appears to be related to Oracle.

                    Fix a problem where very heavy output from the JVM can cause the Wrapper to

                    Made it possible to use the wrapper.pidfile property on all *nix platforms.
                    Please notice that the property has been removed from the default
                    wrapper.conf file.  The property is not needed when the wrapper is launched
                    with the bash shell script.  The sh shell script will set the wrapper.pidfile
                    when the wrapper is launched.  If either of the scripts provided with the
                    Wrapper distribution are used then the wrapper.pidfile should always be
                    removed from your wrapper.conf file.

                    Added a new wrapper.daemonize property which, when set, will form the wrapper
                    process to be a detached non-session group leader.  This makes it possible to
                    launch the wrapper in such a way that it will not be terminated when the user
                    launching the process logs out.  This had been a problem on Solaris systems
                    when using the sh shell.  The default sh and bash scripts both make use of
                    this in the default.  Please update your scripts for use with this version.

                    non-daemon threads in BEA's JRockit Virtual Machine.  This was causing the
                    application to shutdown when the non-daemon thread count dropped to 1.

                    Modify the Win32 version of the Wrapper so that Environment Variables are
                    always read from the system registry when the Wrapper is run as a service.
                    By doing this, it makes it possible to change or add the system environment
                    variables and have them take effect without having to first reboot the
                    machine.

<p>
                    Changed the default value for the wrapper.java.initmemory property to be 3Mb.
                    The default on Windows and Linux JVMs is 2Mb, but the Solaris JVM requires
                    a minimum of 3Mb.  The minimum value accepted by the Wrapper was changed
                    from 8Mb to 1Mb to make it possible to reduce the footprint of applications
                    to what is possible without using the wrapper.

<p>
                    Improve the parsing of configuration files so that leading and trailing white
                    space is now correctly trimmed.  It is also now possible to have comments at
                    the end of a line containing a property.

                    they no longer look like a problem with Wrapper configuration.

                    wrapper.conf file will now be evaluated as the file is loaded.  The windows
                    syntax for environment variables is used on all platforms to make them
                    platform independent.

                    write locks when a read lock is all that is needed.  Made the wrapper fail
                    on startup if another application held a read lock on the conf file.

                    Modified the message displayed when the native library could not be found,
                    so that it is much more descriptive.  Hopefully it will cut down on questions
                    caused by configuration problems.

                    Implemented feature request #613539. Modified the wrapper.java.library.path
                    to function like the wrapper.java.classpath.n properties so that multiple
                    directories can be specified in the library path in a platform independent
                    way.  The old property is still supported, but deprecated.

                    Fix Bug #632215.  The WrapperManager.isLaunchedAsService() method was always
                    returning false, even when run as a service under Windows.  On Linux, the
                    Wrapper is always run as a console app, so this method will always return
                    false.
                </p>

<p>
                    Improve the message thrown when user code attempts to access System.in from
                    within a JVM being controlled by the Wrapper.  System.in will not work
                    because the JVM is a spawned process.

                    Added a new property, wrapper.cpu.timeout, which allows the user to control
                    how much time without receiving any CPU the Wrapper will tolerate before
                    displaying a warning message.  The CPU timeout feature was added in 2.2.7
                    but the default timeout of 10 seconds was not configurable.

                    The Wrapper was only allowing 5 seconds between the JVM informing the
                    Wrapper that it was going to exit and the JVM process actually exiting.
                    This would cause the Wrapper to terminate the process prematurely in
                    cases where an application shutdown thread took longer than 5 seconds to
                    complete.  The Wrapper now allows wrapper.jvm_exit.timeout seconds for
                    the JVM process to exit on its own before being forcibly terminated.
                </p>

<p>
                    When there is a configuration problem or a resource is unavailable, a JVM
                    will sometimes exit abnormally very shortly after being launched.  This
                    can lead the the JVM being infinitely restarted due to a simple class
                    path misconfiguration.  To work around this, the Wrapper has always had
                    a hard limit of 5 restarts within a short period of time.  If the JVM
                    has been running for more than a few minutes, then the count was reset.
                    In this version, a new property. wrapper.max_failed_invocations was added
                    to allow the max value to be set.   The time period which the JVM must
                    now be running for the JVM launch to have been considered a success for
                    restart purposes is set using the new wrapper.successful_invocation_time
                    property.

                    The number of advanced properties which most users do not need has been
                    increasing as the Wrapper has been made more and more flexible.  This
                    has been causing confusion in their usage by people who play with them
                    without first reading the documentation.  To solve this, the advanced
                    properties were removed from the default configuration file.  They still
                    function.  But users must now read to the advanced configuration
                    documentation to learn about their existence.  Added quite about to the
                    descriptions of these properties to hopefully clear up any confusion
                    about their usage.

                    When the JVM exits abnormally, the Wrapper will pause for a few seconds
                    before starting another JVM.  If the user pressed CTRL-C during this
                    pause, a new JVM would still be launched.  The new JVM was exiting
                    immediately but it was a waste of time.  The Wrapper now recognizes the
                    event and aborts launching the new JVM.

                    Added a page to the documentation which shows inline javadocs.  This

                    the application.

                    Fix a problem where the JVM was trying to reconnect the Wrapper as it was

                    Fix a problem where the Wrapper was not shutting down the JVM correctly when
                    all non daemon threads completed.   Normally a JVM will exit when all of its
                    non daemon threads have completed so this was causing some problems.

                    Added the ability to set the priority of the Wrapper and its JVM when run
                    as an NT service or console application.  The same thing can be better
                    achieved on Unix systems by using "nice" in the shell script used to launch
                    the Wrapper.  See the documentation for for details.

                    Fixed a problem on windows where the java command was looking in the windows
                    system and system32 directories for the java executable before checking the
                    path when the full path to the java executable was not specified in the
                    configuration file.  This could lead to different JVM being run from the
                    Wrapper than was run if java -version was run from the command line.  The
                    Wrapper will now attempt to resolve the full java path using the PATH

                    Set mode of executables in binary release tar files so that they can be run

                    Fixed line feeds in release so that bat files are always CRLF, unix scripts
                    are always LF.  Other source files are always CRLF in ZIP archives and LF in
                    tar.gz archives.

                    Added an empty wrapper.log to the releases so that the TestWrapper example

                    Add sample scripts and wrapper.conf files in the bin and lib directories.
                    These scripts are used to start a sample application which runs out of the box.

                    Enable relative paths for Windows version.  In previous versions of Wrapper,
                    it was necessary to always use absolute paths because the working directory of
                    the wrapper would be then NT System32 directory when run as a service.

<p>
                    On the windows version, the wrapper always sets the current working directory
                    to the location of the wrapper executable immediately after startup.
